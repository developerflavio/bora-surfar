### This website is my final project of Harvard CS50 course. "Bora surfar" means "Let's surf" in portuguese. 

### The project followed the Web Development track of the course, the implementation is based on MERN stack (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS). The domain is already registered and the final version of the website will be deployed soon.
